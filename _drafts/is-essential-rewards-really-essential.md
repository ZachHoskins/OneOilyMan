What is it, and is it really essential?

Essential Rewards, in simplest terms, is a monthly wellness box, filled with Young Living products that you get to customize every month. That means you will get products that *YOU* need and want. Sometimes it is exciting to get random things in a monthly box like other subscription services, but I find it more exciting to get something that I know I will use, that will help my health, and that I've been wanting for a while. The only requirement to stay on Essential Rewards is to maintain an order of at least 50 PV (which usually equates to about $50). However, there is no sign-up fee, no cancellation fee, and no contract (so you can cancel at any time).

# Transfer Buying
The first thing I thought when deciding if it was right for us to join Essential Rewards was: "$50 is a lot of money that we don't have right now" and I was right. Even with all of the great perks that came with being on Essential Rewards, we simply did not have an extra $50 in our budget to dedicate each month to Essential Rewards. We could have easily just decided then and there, that this was not for us, but instead, we looked deeper to see how we could really make it work. What we eventually realized was that the products that we were already buying every month from retail stores, Young Living offered those same types of products.

After learning about all of the toxic ingredients that were in the products we were already buying, we *slowly* started to remove those items we were using, and replaced them with Young Living products.

Just what kind of products am I talking about? Toothpaste, soap, shampoo, conditioner, candles, deodorant, all cleaning supplies, supplements, cologne/perfume, all my wife's makeup supplies, just to name a few. Young Living has over 600+ products, so chances are they have something for you.

I feel it's important to point out that we did not switch out all of these products all at once (in fact, there are still things we are working on switching out). Instead, we would look at what we normally spend on various items, and then instead we would add products that met the same need to our Essential Rewards order every month. So we aren't necessarily spending an extra $50 now, but rather transferring money we were already spending in our budget from one category to another. 

An example of this for us was a couple months ago when we ran out of laundry detergent. Instead of getting more the next time we were at the store, we decided to transfer that purchase from our laundry/cleaning supplies budget to our Essential Rewards budget. This didn't get us to the minimum 50 PV, and we had to transfer a couple more things. 

At face value this laundry soap from Young Living seems like it may be a lot more money than we were spending before, but like so many other products Young Living has, it is very highly concentrated. That means we were able to dilute it by separating it into three bottles, and filling the rest with water. Then we just use two pumps for a large load of laundry in the same place have put in our store-bought detergent. That being said, this Thieves Laundry Soap is going to last us so much longer than if we had bought several bottles of laundry detergent from the store.

Getting products like these delivered to our front door every month makes it so much more convenient as we are having to make less special runs to the store to get items we ran low on. On top of that, we know that we can trust everything that we are receiving to be held to the [very high standards](https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/discover/seed-to-seal) Young Living has for all of their products.

# What's in it For Me?
Well, I'm glad you asked. Essential Rewards is the most cost-effective ways for us to continually support our health on a regular basis. You may even be able to get your Essential Rewards order for **free** each month. 

There are many other ways that Essential Rewards benefits me and Sammy. We have found that Young Living is one of the most generous companies we know of when it comes to this aspect. So, I will speak from that experience.

## 1. Receive Free Points Back
When you are on Essential Rewards, you earn a generous amount of points back on every Essential Rewards purchase that you can then use to get free products. Here is the breakdown of the amount of ER points you can get back on each Essential Rewards Purchase:

 - **Month 1-3:**  Receive 10% back in ER points
 - **Month 4-24:** Receive 20% back in ER points
 - **Month 25+:** Receive 25% back in ER points

In all reality, the amount of points you get back is unheard of in the retail scene. I get excited when I get $5 in cash back for every $50 spent at a store, when I get 11% back as an in-store-credit at Menards®, and I've looked into getting a credit card with up to 2-5% cash back. So, I find it amazing that Young Living is so generous with the amount of points they award to their members who join Essential Rewards. These points truly add up so fast, and in what seems like no time, we have enough points to buy a product or oil that we have been wanting to try for so long but couldn't afford.


| Percentage | Cash Back on $1000 |
| :--: | :--: |
| 2% | $20 |
| 5% | $50 |
| 10% | $100 | 
| 20% | $200 | 
| 25% | $250 |

Getting $20 back for spending $1000 doesn't seem very appealing to me, and that is one of the reasons why I still have yet to sign up for a cash back credit card. On the other hand, seeing that I can get $200 or $250 back when I spend $1000 is a no-brainer to me. 

Why would I not do that?? Or better yet: I can't afford *NOT* to do that!

I know, I know, "Who would spend $1000 on oils?"

Well, if you look at your budget at all of the different areas that Young Living products can replace, it is very possible to spend this much in a year's time. Why not make the decision to transfer your spending, and get rewarded so generously as a result?!

## 2. Loyalty Gifts at 3, 6, 9, and 12 Months
In addition to the generous points back that you will earn each month, Young Living will also send you a Loyalty Gift every 3 months for the first year, and then once a year thereafter!
