      <content type="html" xml:base="/2019/11/09/our-bodies-are-temples">&lt;p&gt;If our bodies are temples, what does that have to say about what we put in our bodies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-corinthians-61920&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 6:19–20:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[19] Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit
within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, [20] for you
were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. (ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage of Scripture is specifically talking about sexual immorality; however, I believe that we can apply the concept of our bodies being temples of the Holy Spirit to more areas of our life than we normally do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very easy for me to just quickly read over these verses, and not dive deep into what other implications these verses can have on my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;picture-a-real-temple&quot;&gt;Picture A Real Temple:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you inherit a very grand temple. This temple is made of the finest materials and is very thoughtfully designed. You’ve never seen a more breathtaking building before. On top of that, the Holy Spirit lives inside those very walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine that a strong storm came, and destroyed part of one of the temple walls. I don’t know about you, but knowing that God himself lives within that temple, it would be my highest priority to restore that temple to the glory that it once had. By restoring that temple to the best it could be, I would be glorifying the Holy Spirit inside of the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is such a no-brainer when thinking about an actual, physical building, but I often miss it when thinking about my body as a temple of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were meant to live forever with God, and our bodies too. However, when sin entered the world, our bodies slowly started to die. They slowly started to break down over time, just like any physical building would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can either slow down the effects of sin on our bodies or speed them up by our lifestyle choices. These include what we put in our bodies to sustain us, how much exercise we get, and how much we are resting our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say all this, but I feel like I am the worst in all of these areas. I don’t always eat very well, I don’t exercise nearly as often as I would like to, and I tend to not rest as much as I probably should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being intentional about all of these areas is one very practical way that I can be intentional about restoring the temple that God has given to me to the best it can be on this side of Heaven. By doing so, I can glorify God in my body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-god-care-about-my-health&quot;&gt;Does God Care About My Health?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in Paul’s letter to the church in Corinth, he makes it clear that God is very serious when it comes to His temple, to the point that he says God will destroy anyone who destroys His temple. Paul then takes it one step further and tells us that believers are the very temple that he is talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-corinthians-317&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 3:17:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[16] Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit
dwells in you? [17] If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy
him. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple. (ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One verse that keeps coming to mind as I write this is 1 Samuel 16:7 that says “[7] …man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.” (ESV) Maybe I am thinking humanly, and looking at the outward appearance instead of being more concerned about my heart. Although, I believe that our overall health is much more important than our physique, or what we clothe ourselves with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also believe that God wants everyone to be healthy. If I am sick in bed all the time, or limit my lifespan because of my choices, then I may be limiting God’s ministry in my life. If I live a longer, healthier life, then I may have more opportunities to spread the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yes, God does care about your health as making your health a priority might allow you the opportunity to glorify Him more through your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that there are circumstances related to our health that can be out of our control, but we can have faith that God will keep His word from Romans 8:28, that “all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose” (ESV). There are just many health-related issues that we could avoid by making healthier choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-young-living-fit-into-all-of-this&quot;&gt;How Does Young Living Fit Into All of This?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the products that we get off the shelf at stores can have very toxic or harmful ingredients in them. Even the ones that say they are “Natural” or “Green!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the dandruff shampoos, hair gel, cologne, lotion, and cleaning supplies that Sammy and I used or may still be using have possible cancer-causing ingredients in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think God would be pleased with me if I was knowingly putting chemicals in my body that I knew could cause serious health issues later in life just because it is convenient for me to do so. Doing what is comfortable or easy rarely allows us the opportunity to glorify God, and it is often when we die to ourselves that He is glorified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying these things to shame or guilt-trip anyone. I’m saying these things to myself as well because I know there are some products that I am still using that could be harming my health, and I struggle sometimes with preferring convenience over my long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convenience is one attribute that my generation highly values, and I have found that Young Living is a very convenient way for me to be intentional about many of my health needs. There are many products that we have started ordering online that we used to buy in the store, and we can be confident that all of these products are good for our health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to make sure I’m getting the exercise and rest that my body needs, but having a one-stop shop that we can go to for many of the products that we use daily is helping us make our health a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t always so on-board with Young Living and was very skeptical at first. Then I went to one of their farms and got to see the care that they put into every part of the oil-making process. From planting to harvesting, distilling, and even bottling their oils, they maintained every part in the process. With how much care I saw them have for their oils, I know I can trust them with the rest of their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young Living truly cares about people over profit, and when I am looking for ways to provide health for my family, I want to use products from someone who cares more about my health than their bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/2019/07/29/why-young-living">&lt;p&gt;Everyone is using essential oils these days. &lt;em&gt;But which oils are the best?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seek to answer your questions about who you can trust, what oils are most effective, who gives you the best bang for your buck, and more! Continue reading to explore all that is Young Living and learn what makes its products and the company as a whole different from everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the founder and the foundation, to oils and supplements, through quality products and community support, you will learn how all these combined create a company committed to providing you with nature’s best. Young Living empowers you to be well, discover your true potential, and live a purposeful life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;man-on-a-mission&quot;&gt;Man on a Mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/why-young-living/man-on-a-mission.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Man on a Mission&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Necessity is the mother of invention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When D. Gary Young found himself confined to a wheelchair with a prognosis that he would never walk again after a severe logging accident in 1973, Young Living was born, although this dream would not be fully realized until 21 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three suicide attempts, hitting rock bottom, feeling “disconnected from God, my family and the world”, and some “tough love” from his father, Gary resolved that “if it’s the last thing I do, I will get out of this bed, and I will walk and ride my horse again!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is when we find ourselves at our weakest points in life that our greatest strengths are born. This led Gary to explore different avenues of healing, grow his knowledge of herbs, reconnect with his Creator, travel the world to learn about the production, usage and application of essential oils, and bring his attention to the many other people also needing help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary purchased farmland, planted crops, and built his own distillery. In 1994, along with his wife Mary, they began cultivating lavender, peppermint, melissa, clary sage, and many other herbs. He saw the need for top-quality essential oils, and he continued to grow and expand his knowledge, acreage, and technology. Coupled with Mary’s previous knowledge of the direct-selling industry, together they grew Young Living into the world leader in essential oils and wellness solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through all of the success (and failure), there is one thing that Gary and Mary never lost sight of… &lt;strong&gt;the people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people-over-profit&quot;&gt;People Over Profit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/why-young-living/people-over-profit.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;People Over Profit&quot; /&gt;
Gary’s heart for people shows through in the development of the D. Gary Young, Young Living Foundation, which is committed to empowering individuals to achieve their potential and to defy limitations by providing wellness and education opportunities to underserved communities. Every penny donated goes directly to those in need because 100% of the administrative costs are covered by Young Living. Donating can be as simple as rounding up your order to the nearest dollar. Over 250,000 individuals have been impacted by the work of the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;projects-and-partners&quot;&gt;Projects and Partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Young Living Academy, Ecuador&lt;/strong&gt; - Built in 2009 by Gary and Mary Young, the academy educates students in grades pre-K through 12th, maintaining a 97% attendance rate and 100% of seniors graduating each year!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebuild Nepal&lt;/strong&gt; - The Young Living Foundation rebuilt schools and homes in Yarsa, Nepal, after the devastating earthquake in 2015, and is still focused on restoration and rebuilding in Nepal today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope For Justice&lt;/strong&gt; - The focus of this mission is to end human trafficking and modern day slavery. With 10 fully-funded Lighthouse Centers, children rescued from slavery have a safe place to heal, recover, and learn. The Shine Career School in Cambodia also provides those recovering with education and vocational training, gives them hope, and empowers them to follow their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sole Hope&lt;/strong&gt; - The primary focus of this mission is to help children and adults in Uganda become and remain jigger-free. Jiggers are parasitic insects that burrow into an individual’s feet and can cause life- threatening infections. Just by providing antibiotics and shoes, men, women, and children can live and remain jigger free.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healing Faith Uganda&lt;/strong&gt; - This organization provides malaria education, prevention, and treatment to rural villages. In Uganda, 42 children die each day from malaria, and for just $1, Healing Faith can test and treat a child with malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can donate to the Foundation as a general donation or you can donate to a specific project that sits heavy on your heart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-promise-to-you&quot;&gt;Our Promise to You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/why-young-living/seed-to-seal.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Our Promise to You&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seed to Seal&lt;/strong&gt; is a quality commitment and promise Young Living makes to YOU. Seed to Seal consists of three pillars - &lt;strong&gt;Sourcing&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Science&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Standards&lt;/strong&gt;. These three are the foundation on which every product is built and everything that Young Living does. This promise ensures you can trust that Young Living is providing you with products of the highest quality and purity, free from synthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality and purity are important because that is what ensures these products WORK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sourcing&lt;/strong&gt; - Products are sourced from corporate-owned farms, partner farms, and Seed to Seal certified suppliers to ensure consistency, quality, and land conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science&lt;/strong&gt; - With 50 highly-trained scientists, two corporate quality labs, and 12+ independent partner labs, Young Living does meticulous quality testing and retesting to ensure your products are as pure as nature intended.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standards&lt;/strong&gt; - Young Living ethically sources and produces pure ingredients and goes above and beyond to comply with local environmental standards and sustainable growing practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young Living is so much more than just essential oils. With the commitment to helping people experience real wellness, the company offers product lines for every member of your family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;babies&quot;&gt;Babies:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is never too early to start thinking about the health of your children. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ewg.org/news/news-releases/2010/03/05/chairman-rush-chemicals-umbilical-cord-blood-%E2%80%93-including-pbts-%E2%80%93-need&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that some babies have evidence of nearly 300 chemicals already in their bloodstream at birth. Young Living created the Seedlings line to make it easy to choose safe and gentle products for your babies that are free of all the harmful chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kids&quot;&gt;Kids:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a healthy weight isn’t just about a number on the scale. It has so much more to do with how you feel. Slique products will help you support healthy weight management, keep you feeling fuller longer, and give your body the nutritional support it needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;supplements&quot;&gt;Supplements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, we would be eating a perfect diet and our bodies would be receiving all the nutrition needed simply from the foods we eat. Unfortunately, that is not the case. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ewg.org/research/how-much-is-too-much/appendix-b-vitamin-and-mineral-deficiencies-us&quot;&gt;The Environmental Working Group&lt;/a&gt;  found that “more than 40 percent of adults have dietary intakes of vitamin A, C, D and E, calcium and magnesium below the average requirement for their age and gender.” This is why you need to supplement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing the absorption of Multigreens showed that 42% was absorbed in 24 hours. After adding essential oils to the formula, blood absorption increased to 64% in 30 minutes and 86% in one hour (info taken from the &lt;em&gt;Essential Oils Desk Reference&lt;/em&gt;). This means you are actually using more and eliminating less! Be sure you are getting the most out of your supplements by choosing those that are infused with essential oils, aka Young Living supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you embark on a journey to live a life filled with wellness, purpose, and abundance, it takes more than just one drop of oil to get you there. Embracing Young Living is &lt;em&gt;embracing a lifestyle&lt;/em&gt; - making a commitment to better choices for you and your family and helping others do the same thing. When you do this, you will reap the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preferred Customers&lt;/strong&gt; make up 89.5% of Young Living members. These are people just like you and me who have decided to embrace everything that Young Living offers and enjoy all the member benefits, some of which include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;24% discount on all the 600+ life-changing products&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;access to a full library of resources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the ability to join Essential Rewards and take advantage of convenient monthly shipments, free/ reduced shipping, free promotional products, and points back on every order that can be redeemed on a future purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Builders&lt;/strong&gt; make up 10.5% of Young Living members. Don’t let that term scare you. These are people just like you and me who cannot help but share with others the difference Young Living has made in their lives. As a result, others are empowered to begin their own wellness journey. When this happens, Young Living’s generous compensation plan kicks in to create the opportunity for you to earn an additional income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/why-young-living/community.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Community&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aspect about this company that cannot be conveyed through a blog post is the &lt;strong&gt;community&lt;/strong&gt;. Young Living is not just a company. It is a family. You have to experience it for yourself to fully understand, but there is definitely something different and special about this community. It started with Gary and lives on through everyone he touched and who they touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t already part of this amazing family, I would love to help you get started. Let’s connect and work together to figure out your most pressing needs and find the perfect starter kit for you!&lt;/p&gt;
