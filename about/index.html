                <p><em>Hi, my name is Zach Hoskins, and my beautiful wife here in this picture is Sammy! My goal of this blog is to help show that essential oils are not just for women, and that any man, woman, child, baby, or pet could benefit from all of the great products Young Living has to offer.</em></p>

<p>When I was first introduced to Young Living Essential Oils, I too was very skeptical. I thought these oils were just some sort of placebo that just so happened to smell great. At that point, I was unaware of the science behind essential oils, and the thousands of references in the  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">US National Library of Medicine</a>  regarding the benefits of these oils. So all I had to go off of at this point was my wifeâ€™s experience and mine. I did not expect to be as impressed in these oils as I was, but here I am with my own account now because of how impactful these have been in my life.</p>

<p>Our experience alone was enough to sell me on making the lifestyle switch to using essential oils and other natural products instead of what we were currently using. The three oils that really made me a believer were  <a href="https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/digize-essential-oil-blend">DiGize</a>,  <a href="https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/panaway-essential-oil-blend">PanAway</a>, and  <a href="https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/thieves-essential-oil-blend">Thieves</a>. I was just blown away by how much these oils helped me, and how quickly they worked (within minutes!).</p>

<p>So at that point, I was at a crossroads. I could either lie to myself and my wife about the experience I had with the oils, or support her in her dream to make our home a chemical free one. I thank God that I was smart that day, and chose the latter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would love to speak in more detail about my experience with these three oils to anyone who is interested. I enjoy sharing about these oils; so donâ€™t be afraid to ask!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those experiences were in 2017 after we signed up as Young Living members. We didnâ€™t do the business side of Young Living right away, but just continued exploring and getting to love more products that Young Living had to offer. Our Enroller did a great job at educating us as well as providing us with resources that helped us learn about different ways to use these products. She also helped introduce us to the large community of other oilers, and we were taken back by how loving and caring they were towards others. We are so grateful for her introducing us to this lifestyle, and desire to do the same thing for others.</p>

<p>In 2019 I signed up for my own account under my wifeâ€™s team. I also attended the 2019 International Grand Convention, and I absolutely loved that experience. It gave me such a better understanding of where the company came from, their strong belief system and desire to truly make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives, and their high quality  <a href="https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/discover/seed-to-seal">Seed to SealÂ®</a>  standards. I also gained an appreciation for Young Living and the fact that they truly strive for purpose over profit.</p>

<p>One big takeaway for me from the 2019 Convention was that if I truly do believe these oils are helping me and that other people would benefit from using them, then it is selfish of me to keep that information to myself. It is selfish of me to not share about how they have helped me, and how they could help others too. From that conviction I became more serious about sharing openly about how these oils help me, and out of that birthed this blog.</p>

<p>I am very excited for you to join me on this journey! I hope that this blog educates you about Young Living, and encourages you to try for yourself to see how these products can benefit your life!
